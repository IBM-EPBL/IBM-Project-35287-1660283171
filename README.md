#PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

The project deals on building an application which helps the specially challenged people to communicate between them and the common people. Communication between a person with hearing/speech impairment and a normal person has always been a challenging task. This application tries to reduce the barrier of communication by developing an assistive application for specially challenged people.

## Project Design & Planning
## Ideation Phase

      Ideation is the process where you generate ideas and solutions through sessions such as Sketching, Prototyping, Brainstorming, Brainwriting, Worst Possible Idea, and a wealth of other ideation techniques.
      
- [x] Literature Survey
- [x] Problem Statement
- [x] Empathy Map

## Design Phase 
      In the design phase, one or more designs are developed, with which the project result can apparently be achieved. Depending on the subject of the project, the products of the design phase can include dioramas, sketches etc
